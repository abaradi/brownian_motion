# Brownian Motion

A script simulating the physics of brownian motion. The yellow grain is 20 times more massive than the molecules surrounding it. The model's underlying physics and assumptions can be found in [Brownian Model](/model/Brownian%20Motion.pdf). Due to frame rate issues the gif is slowed down, I recommend downloading the mp4 file [Brownian Animation](/brownian_animation.mp4) to observe the brownian motion in real time.
